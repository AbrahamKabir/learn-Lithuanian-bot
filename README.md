Lithuania is known for its unique language, and as I prepare to study at Vilnius University, I wanted to dive deeper into Lithuanian culture by creating a language learning bot. This project not only allows me to explore Python and its interactive capabilities but also strengthens my commitment to immerse myself in the Lithuanian culture and language before I arrive.
